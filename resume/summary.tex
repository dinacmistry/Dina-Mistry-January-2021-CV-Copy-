% Computational researcher
I am a research scientist
with an interdisciplinary background in physics, network science, and epidemiology.
% I have 
7 years of experience modeling real world complex systems, contagion phenomena, and human contact networks.
% My interests lie in understanding the foundations of 
% complex systems
% % complex systems in the real world 
% and developing tools and methods for data driven research in health, misinformation, and social good.
My interests lie in developing methods for data driven research in health and misinformation which center on justly representing diverse communities, cultures, and behaviors. I am also committed to diversifying science and have co-founded Diversify NetSci, an annual international meeting to push for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of Network Science.
